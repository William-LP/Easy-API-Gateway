Hugo modules let you pull in the theme directly from its online source. Theme is downloaded automatically and managed by Hugo.\nGit Submodule: Alternatively, add Hextra as a Git Submodule. The theme is downloaded by Git and stored in your project’s themes folder.\nSetup Hextra as Hugo module Prerequisites Before starting, you need to have the following software installed:\nHugo (extended version) Git Go Steps Initialize a new Hugo site hugo new site my-site --format=yaml Configure Hextra theme via module # initialize hugo module cd my-site hugo mod init github.com/username/my-site # add Hextra theme hugo mod get github.com/imfing/hextra Configure hugo.yaml to use Hextra theme by adding the following:\nmodule: imports: - path: github.com/imfing/hextra Create your first content pages Create new content page for the home page and the documentation page:\nhugo new content/_index.md hugo new content/docs/_index.md Preview the site locally hugo server --buildDrafts --disableFastRender Voila, your new site preview is available at http://localhost:1313/.\nSetup Hextra as Git submodule Prerequisites Before starting, you need to have the following software installed:\nHugo (extended version) Git Steps Initialize a new Hugo site hugo new site my-site --format=yaml Add Hextra theme as a Git submodule git submodule add https://github.com/imfing/hextra.git themes/hextra Configure hugo.yaml to use Hextra theme by adding the following:\ntheme: hextra Create your first content pages Create new content page for the home page and the documentation page:\nhugo new content/_index.md hugo new content/docs/_index.md Preview the site locally hugo server --buildDrafts --disableFastRender Your new site preview is available at http://localhost:1313/.\nWhen using CI/CD for Hugo website deployment, it’s essential to ensure that the following command is executed before running the hugo command.\ngit submodule update --init Failure to run this command results in the theme folder not being populated with Hextra theme files, leading to a build failure.\nNext Explore the following sections to start adding more contents:\nOrganize Files\rConfiguration\rMarkdown","quick-start-from-template#Quick Start from Template":"","start-as-new-project#Start as New Project":""},"title":"Why"}}
